This is a URL shrinker made using Python and tkinter. It allows users to enter a long URL and get a shortened URL that they can use to share the link more easily.

## Installation
To use the URL shrinker, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the URL shrinker, simply run the __*`url_shrinker.py`*__ file:
```
python url_shrinker.py
```

This will open up the URL shrinker window, where you can enter a long URL and get a shortened URL. To use the shortened URL, simply copy it from the output box and use it wherever you need to share the link.
